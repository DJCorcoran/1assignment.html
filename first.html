	<h1>Hello, SPA class. My name is Douglas!</h1>
	<img src="Images/Card.png">
	<h2>Hometown!</h2>
	<p>I was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, before moving around the U.S.A.</p>
	<h3>My Background!</h4>
	<p>I was an Executive Chef for over 25 years before picking up a camera and creating art in a different way...through film! Life's adventures have provided me the opportunity to run a couple small websites for both my local chef's association and the Dietary Manager's Association. However, I acheived this through the help of a website management site. I have no software development experience.</p>
	<h4>Why?</h5>
	<p>I am working towards my graduate degree.  I am majoring in Digital Media Design.  After taking a class using Notion and writing a little code, I wanted to understand and learn how to write code! I would like to get familiar with code while learning to create a web page.  My ultimate goal is to make a web page for my production company.</p>
	<h5>My Favorite Place! Martinique!</h6>

	<h6> My Favorite Restaurant! Stardust NYC!
	<p> It is not my favorite restaurant for the food but for the entertainment.  Every server in this diner in NYC is hoping to perform on Broadway!  The servers take turns singing while you eat your food!
